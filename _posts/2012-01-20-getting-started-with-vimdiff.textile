Getting started with Vimdiff
Keyboard Shortcuts:

[c - Jump to the previous change.

Ctrl W + Ctrl W - Switch to the other split window.

Update: Allan commented these two tips that I personally use quite often.

If you load up two files in splits (:vs or :sp), you can do :diffthis on each window and achieve a diff of files that were already loaded in buffers
:diffoff can be used to turn off the diff mode.]
