Vimdiff is a great tool for dealing with merges, especially when you need to do merges of 2+ files.

Typical usage is:

{% highlight bash %}
vimdiff file1 file2
{% endhighlight %}

Keybinding cheat sheet:

do - Use changes from other window in current window.

dp - Use changes from current window in other window.

]c - Go to the next change.

[c - Go to the previous change.

Ctrl W + W - Switch to the other split window.

If you load up two files in splits (:vs or :sp)
You can also do :diffthis on each window and achieve a diff of files that were already loaded in buffers

The :diffoff command turns off diffmode.
