Over the weekend I found a fun "PHP form":http://optics.eee.nottingham.ac.uk/matt/weeknumbers/weeknumbers_form.php that will build week numbers (Monday-Sunday) for arbitrary date ranges. Using it to make a base of week number ICAL files for each of the RIT quarters, I made liberal use of Perl to convert from Monday-Sunday numbered weeks to Monday-Friday numbered weeks, and factored in RIT breaks. The "ICAL file":http://www.ryansb.com/resources/rit_week_numbers_12-13.ical is available, and has week numbers for Fall-Spring of the 12-13 academic year.

Using it is easy: make a new calendar in Google Calendar, then import the "ICAL file":http://www.ryansb.com/resources/rit_week_numbers_12-13.ical to that calendar. Now week numbers will show up as appropriate.

Maybe in the future I'll write a python script to parse RIT's "calendar":http://www.rit.edu/calendar/ and add breaks in as well. Another time, perhaps.
