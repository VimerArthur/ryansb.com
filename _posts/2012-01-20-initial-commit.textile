This is the first post to my new blog/personal site/whatever. I'm using "Jekyll":https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll to build static HTML, it seems pretty neat. Big credit to "gitready.com":http://gitready.com for opening their source, and having a heck of a layout.

Testing Jekyll is also wicked nice, because a single command will serve up your new site on localhost:4000.

<pre>jekyll --server</pre>

Overall, it seems like a really awesome way to run a personal site.

Super lightweight, Git-friendly, and Open Source
