# what is VCS?

* version control system
* control changes
* know what changed, when, and who did it
* share it

---

centralized
===========

---

distributed
===========

---

# centralized
* SVN, RCS, Clearcase
* store diffs
* central database

---

# distributed
* Git, Mercurial
* store blobs
* everyone has a copy of the database
* can have many remotes
* no final authority
* locally

---

# why care?
* concurrency, simply
* easy merges
* fast collaboration

---

# why Git?
* simple design
* fully distributed
* easily handle massive projects (linux)
* cheap branching
* flexibility

---

first, clear your mind
======================

---

# Git is fast
* almost everything is local
* work on planes, trains, and automobiles
* upload when you can

---

# a commit is...
* snapshot, not a diff
* takes up more space, but bits are cheap
* acts almost like a mini filesystem
* store links to files that haven't changed
* refer to commits by checksums (not names)

---

# how to stop worrying #
* Git generally only adds data
* it's hard to lose things once committed
* almost always possible to roll back changes

---

# a commit has...
* a checksum
* a list of all blobs contained in the commit
* a comment (please use these)

# three stages of Git #
<center>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>working</th>
      <th>staging</th>
      <th>repo</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>uncommitted</td>
      <td>preparing to commit</td>
      <td>committed</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</center>

---

# basic workflow #
* one: make some changes
* two: stage snapshots of files
* three: commit
* four: (eventually) push
