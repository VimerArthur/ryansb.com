# working with branches

push one of your branches up to a remote

	!bash
	$ git push origin testfeature:experimental

it's trivial to pull in the remotes of other collaborators

	!bash
	# checkout the branch "grill" from rick (a remote) and call it "bacon"
	$ git checkout --track -b bacon rick/grill
	# check out the same branch, but just call it grill
	$ git checkout -t rick/grill
	# a common one you'll use is this:
	$ git checkout -t origin/feature

to display all local branches

	!bash
	$ git branch
		  master
		* newgitseminar
		  truncatehtml
		  vanilla_960
