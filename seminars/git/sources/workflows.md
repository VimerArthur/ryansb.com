# workflows

* git-flow: we'll get there in a second
* github-style: a unique take on git-flow, with continuous integration in mind
* integration manager: one 'integration manager' is the only person with commit access to a 'blessed' repo
* svn model: central server, can't push if someone has pushed since you last pulled/fetched
* dictator + lieutenants: great for massive projects (cough-linuxkernel-cough) where people are given responsibility for a subsystem ('lieutenants') and passes merged changes to the dictator to be finally commited
